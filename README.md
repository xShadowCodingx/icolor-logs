## About iColor-Logs
This library is a light-weight yet efficient way for you to customize your log colors. Each function returns the console log, so you can wrap it inside of conditionals or whereever else you might want to log information. It uses ANSI color codes that are usable by most consoles to display your text formatted in whichever way you choose.

## Colors
iColor-Logs comes equiped with the universal colors for your logs:

- Black
- Red
- Green
- Yellow
- Blue
- Magenta
- Cyan
- White
- Default
- Reset

## Usage
Depending on how you want to utilize the colors, there are a couple methods you can do to accomplish formatting your console logs.

### Themes
The easiest way to implement logs is to use the built-in themes that comes with the library. The following themes are available:

- Default
- Default Inverted
- High Contrast
- Creative
- Light

Each of these themes gives your logs different colors based on what kind of log you are showing. Please see **Log Types** to understand how it affects your formatting.

#### Default Theme
The Default theme of iColor-Logs is a basic, yet elegant log formatting. As you can see below, the text (foreground) color is the only thing this theme manipulates.

#### Default Inverted Theme
As the title states, its the inverted style of the Default Theme. You can expect the color to be on the background, and the text itself will be white.
